	      Mohamed Salah Hamed Mahrous Ghaly , Egyptian Arabic pronunciation:  born 15 June 1992) is an Egyptian professional footballer 
		  who plays as a forward for Premier League club Liverpool and the Egypt national team. Considered one of the best players in the world,
		  he is known for his finishing, dribbling, and speed.
		  Salah is predominantly known for his speed, movement, clinical finishing, agility, dribbling skills, first touch, 
		  and ball control, as well as his ability to use both his pace and flair on the ball in order to beat opponents,
		  and create scoring opportunities for himself or his teammates.A versatile forward,
		  he primarily plays as a winger on the right flank, a position which allows him to cut into the centre onto
		  his stronger left foot, and either shoot on goal or play quick exchanges with other players and make runs in behind 
		  the defence towards goal; he can also play in the centre behind the main striker as either an attacking
		  midfielder or second striker.
		  On his increased threat in front of goal since joining Liverpool, Salah credits Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp’s 
		  request for him to occupy more advanced central positions, often operating as a main striker, 
		  with the forward telling ESPN, "I play closer to the goal than any club before.
		  "Salah initially started his career at the left-back position, however, 
		  following a 4–0 win over the youth team of Egyptian club ENPPI, Salah was in tears for not 
		  scoring after missing several clear
		  chances; this made his coach realize his passion for scoring goals,
		  forcing him to move him to a forward position.

		 Lionel Andrés Messi Cuccittini (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾez ˈmesi] (About this soundlisten);
		 born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward and captains both Spanish club Barcelona 
		 and the Argentina national team. Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded
		 as one of the greatest players of all time, 
		 Messi has won a record six Ballon d'Or awards, 
		 and a record six European Golden Shoes.
		 Due to his short stature, Messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility,
		 allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles;
		 this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica ("The Atomic Flea").
		 Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength,
		 which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance,
		 aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents;
		 he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting.
		 His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick 
		 feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed. His former Barcelona manager
		 Pep Guardiola once stated, "Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it.
		 "[Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a 
		 left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the 
		 inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.
